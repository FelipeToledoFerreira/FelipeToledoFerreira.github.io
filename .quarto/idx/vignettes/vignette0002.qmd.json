Each sample ($N = 240$) contains finely chopped pure meat with different moisture, fat and protein contents. For each meat sample the data consists of a 100 channel spectrum of absorbances and the contents of moisture (water), fat and protein. The absorbance is $-\\log_{10}$ of the transmittance measured by the spectrometer. The three contents, measured in percent, are determined by analytic chemistry (click [here](https://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/tecator) for further details).\n\n```{r data0001, message = FALSE}\nmotorcycle_data = data.frame(id = 1)\nmotorcycle_data$curve = tfd(data = mcycle$accel,\n                            arg = jitter(mcycle$times, amount = 0.1))\nmotorcycle_data$smooth_curve = motorcycle_data$curve |> \n  tfb(basis = \"spline\",\n      verbose = FALSE,\n      k = 15,\n      bs = \"cr\")\ng03 = motorcycle_data |>\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(y = smooth_curve)) +\n  geom_spaghetti() +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(text = element_text(size = unit(11, \"pt\"),\n                            family = \"LM Roman 10\",\n                            color = \"black\"),\n        axis.line = element_line(arrow = grid::arrow(length = unit(0.08, \"cm\"), \n                                                     ends = \"last\",\n                                                     angle = 30,\n                                                     type = \"closed\"),\n                                 linewidth = .25),\n        axis.ticks = element_line(color = \"black\",\n                                  linewidth = .125),\n        legend.position = \"top\") +\n  labs(x = expression(paste(\"Wavelength \", \"(in \", italic(\"nm\"), \")\")),\n       y = \"Absorbance\",\n       col = \"\")\ng03\n```\n\n### The Canadian weather data set\nThe Canadian weather data set\n\n### Simulated data\n$$\n  y_i(t_{i,j}) = \\cos(t_{i,j}) + \\sin(2 t_{i,j}) + \\varepsilon_{i}(t_{i,j})\n$$\nand\n$$\n  y_i(t_{i,j}) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n    -2 \\\\\n    0 \\\\\n    3/2 \\\\\n    3/2 \\\\\n    0 \\\\\n    -1 \\\\\n    -1/2 \\\\\n    -1 \\\\\n    0 \\\\\n    0\n  \\end{pmatrix}\\textbf{B}(t_{i,j}) + \\varepsilon_i(t_{i,j})\n$$\n\n## Setup\nThis vignette is primarily concerned with presenting an approach to sparse Functional Data representation utilizing the Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) framework, itself only a topic in the wider Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) context.
