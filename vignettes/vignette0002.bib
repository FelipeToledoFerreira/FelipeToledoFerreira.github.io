abstract = {This paper introduces a general Bayesian framework for obtaining sparse solutions to regression and classification tasks utilising models linear in the parameters. Although this framework is fully general, we illustrate our approach with a particular specialisation that we denote the 'relevance vector machine' (RVM), a model of identical functional form to the popular and state-of-the-art 'support vector machine' (SVM). We demonstrate that by exploiting a probabilistic Bayesian learning framework, we can derive accurate prediction models which typically utilise dramatically fewer basis functions than a comparable SVM while offering a number of additional advantages. These include the benefits of probabilistic predictions, automatic estimation of 'nuisance' parameters, and the facility to utilise arbitrary basis functions (e.g. non-'Mercer' kernels). We detail the Bayesian framework and associated learning algorithm for the RVM, and give some illustrative examples of its application along with some comparative benchmarks. We offer some explanation for the exceptional degree of sparsity obtained, and discuss and demonstrate some of the advantageous features, and potential extensions, of Bayesian relevance learning.},

    abstract = {Non-parametric regression using cubic splines is an attractive, flexible and widely-applicable approach to curve estimation. Although the basic idea was formulated many years ago, the method is not as widely known or adopted as perhaps it should be. The topics and examples discussed in this paper are intended to promote the understanding and extend the practicability of the spline smoothing methodology. Particular subjects covered include the basic principles of the method; the relation with moving average and other smoothing methods; the automatic choice of the amount of smoothing; and the use of residuals for diagnostic checking and model adaptation. The question of providing inference regions for curves – and for relevant properties of curves – is approached via a finite-dimensional Bayesian formulation.},

    abstract = { Considering the context of functional data analysis, we developed and applied a new Bayesian approach via the Gibbs sampler to select basis functions for a finite representation of functional data. The proposed methodology uses Bernoulli latent variables to assign zero to some of the basis function coefficients with a positive probability. This procedure allows for an adaptive basis selection since it can determine the number of bases and which ones should be selected to represent functional data. Moreover, the proposed procedure measures the uncertainty of the selection process and can be applied to multiple curves simultaneously. The methodology developed can deal with observed curves that may differ due to experimental error and random individual differences between subjects, which one can observe in a real dataset application involving daily numbers of COVID-19 cases in Brazil. Simulation studies show the main properties of the proposed method, such as its accuracy in estimating the coefficients and the strength of the procedure to find the true set of basis functions. Despite having been developed in the context of functional data analysis, we also compared the proposed model via simulation with the well-established LASSO and Bayesian LASSO, which are methods developed for non-functional data. }
